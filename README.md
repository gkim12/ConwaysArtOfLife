# Conway's Art of Life
Java GUI application used to create moving, visual art for my UChicago visual arts class.

## Running the program

Clone the repository and import repo into the [Eclipse IDE](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/).

Click *Run > Run* in the top of the IDE and wait for the program to compile and start up

The application will start with a default 5x5 grid with black border. 

- Clicking on a cell will color it, right-clicking will uncolor it.

- You have the option to change the simulation speed and cell size in the bottom using the appropriate sliders

- Clicking the *Play* button or hitting spacebar will let the simulation run continuously, hitting it again will stop it

- The *Next Generation* button goes through one iteration/frame of the simulation
